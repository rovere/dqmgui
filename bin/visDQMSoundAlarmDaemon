# IMPORTANT: If you want to play a test sound, just start the program with
# all the usual parameters, but add "test" as last parameter.
# Then the program will not start in daemon mode, but just send a test sound to
# the sound server.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# The SoundAlarm agent monitors the state of alarms in histograms
# located in ERROR_FOLDER. This location is a layout with a selection
# of MEs that follow very closely the state of the detector. The agent
# makes the following assumptions:
# 1. Each ME listed in the layout will raise an alarm if its QT fails,
# however, the ME and QT have to be done in such way that, if the
# condition for the QT to fail ceases, the QT should be successful
# and thus the alarm should be turned off.
# 2. Trend plots located in this layout should *not* raise alarms, if
# they do, they must comply with assumption 1.
# 3. The GUI that is specified by BASEURL has a Live source.
#
# Once a ME raises an alarm it would be immediately broadcasted, after
# that it gets bundled with all actives alarms so that only one
# message is broadcasted every REMINDERINTERVAL seconds. An alarm
# ceases to be broadcasted if it has been sent more than REBROADCAST
# times. In order to generate the most efficient use of the CMS-WOW
# system, the global clock gets reset every time we pass from 0 alarms
# to at least 1 alarm.

# There is an extension to this tool called visDQMSoundAlarmManager.
# It's a small web app which displays all plots located in ERROR_FOLDER
# and provides an ability to disable alarms for chosen plots. 
# This tool queries the API of the visDQMSoundAlarmManager for the list 
# of disabled plots before sending the alarms.
